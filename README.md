# This Project Has Moved

**The MEG Compliance SDK has been moved to its official organization on GitHub.**

All source code, packages, and development discussions are now located at the new repository:

## -> [https://github.com/meg-initiative/meg-sdk](https://github.com/meg-initiative/meg-sdk)

This repository (`adistan/mec-sdk`) is now archived and will no longer be updated. Please update your bookmarks and direct all future contributions, issues, and pull requests to the new location.

Thank you for your interest in the MEG SDK.
